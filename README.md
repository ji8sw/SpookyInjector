Baker Injector is the ultra simple DLL injector that is paired with the Baker cheat for Schedule I, it is ultra simple.

## Inject
Once clicked, the inject button will ask you to select a DLL file to inject, once you select one it will find `Schedule I.exe` and inject. There is no way to inject a DLL into another process unless you change the source code, it is designed this way.

## Open Baker Folder
Once clicked, will open the folder associated with Spooky (`%appdata%/Baker`), this folder holds configuration files.

## Auto Inject
Once toggled on, it will ask you for a DLL file and then proceed to wait until Schedule I is opened, before injecting the selected DLL (after 5s)
